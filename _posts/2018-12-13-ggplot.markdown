My most recent freelance gig had me build reporting software for a project management system. In the past I had created reports for classes using ggplot2, but never really dove into difficult or interesting visualizations because the assignments only required specific, simple implementations.

Getting started on my first UpWork project has required me to do some more in depth data analysis, and my requirements for my deliverables were in turn more vague.

In the pursuit of making the information my client was interested in clear and understandable, I went through many iterations and discovered a bunch of new ggplot2 functions. My favorite new thing I discovered was the `facet_wrap()` [function, which makes it easy to make organized grids of graphs!](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/facet_wrap/) Below is a picture of that report showing a year over year analysis of mean issue ticket times.

This project was great because I had the chance to work a problem end-to-end with a real world client. He needed to grab data from issue tracking software and pull it into R. I ended up using the system's JSON API, but found there to be a limit in the amount of records per request. I ended up iteratively appending the dataframes to each other, although there was likely a simpler solution I could've used with [pagination in JSON](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12168624/pagination-response-payload-from-a-restful-api)

I hope to get to work on similar projects soon!
