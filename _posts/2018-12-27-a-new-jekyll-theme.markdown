Hello there, hope your holidays went well!

In the pursuit of a more eye-catching design for my website here, I have migrated to [a theme called minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). It's much more complex than the default theme I had been using, but in turn has a great amount of [awesome documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/quick-start-guide/)! Expect the flashiness quotient of this website to increase exponentially in the next week.

More things I've been looking into include [this awesome standard for creating resumes in JSON](https://github.com/jsonresume), [this writeup about how to containerize data science tools](http://www.makepit.com/production_ds) that I found on [/r/datascience](https://reddit.com/r/datascience), as well as [this cool kaggle starter competition about predicting housing prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
