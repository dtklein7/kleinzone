My plans to fill this site up with previous projects has been on hold, I attempted multiple switches over to [other jekyll themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/) to no avail. I would like to find something minimal that can highlight a mixture of text-based and visual posts.

I have been applying to many entry-level jobs that can propell me to my career goals of becoming a data scientist. In addition, I have started doing freelance work on [UpWork.com](https://www.upwork.com/). I've only been focusing on a single contract of some basic R scripting, but am searching for a longer term project that can help me develop my Python skills.
