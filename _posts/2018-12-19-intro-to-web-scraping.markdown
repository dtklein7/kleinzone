This week I've gotten started using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) using [this tutorial I found on /r/datascience](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/ultimate-guide-web-scraping-w-python-requests-and-beautifulsoup/)

Web scraping is one of the things I've heard of but never tried, I was happy to discover it's less complicated to impliment than I thought it would be. I'm interested in using this tool in the future in conjunction with pandas, matplot-lib , and scikit-learn to make insights into data that might not be readily available via an API, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), or other online sources for datasets.

My progress can be found on [my Github!](https://github.com/dtklein7/python_practice/blob/master/web_scraping_practice_1.ipynb)
