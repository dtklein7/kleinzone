Machine learning is a concept I've heard lots about, but I've had no direct experience using it in any schoolwork. I took two quarters of AMATH where we implemented linear and logistic regression with varying degrees of complexity, but never had projects that focused on data - they focused on the mathematics and implementation ([like manually implementing iterative QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition)). I've also been reading [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) which has been an interesting read. I may try one of the labs from the end of the chapter on linear regression.

All of this is to say, I haven't *actually* used machine learning in a practical sense. In pursuit of my first step of my thousand-mile journey, I've [found this awesome article I'm using as a guide](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/)
